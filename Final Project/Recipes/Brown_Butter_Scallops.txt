Brown Butter Scallops
1 Â¼ pounds scallops, 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1 clove garlic, 4 sprigs fresh thyme, 1 lemon
1. Remove the small side muscle from the scallops, rinse with cold water and thoroughly pat dry.
2. Season scallops with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
3. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Working in batches, add scallops to the skillet in a single layer and cook, flipping once, until golden brown and translucent in the center, about 1-2 minutes per side. Set aside and keep warm.
4. Reduce heat to medium low; melt remaining 5 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the butter starts to foam.
5. Add garlic and thyme to the skillet, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
6. Return scallops to the skillet; spoon butter over scallops for 1 minute.
7. Serve immediately with lemon wedges.
