Crispy Sesame Beef
1 cup peanut oil, 1 pound sirloin steak, 4 tablespoons cornstarch, ¼ cup reduced sodium soy sauce, ¼ cup brown sugar, 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice, 2 tablespoons rice vinegar, 2 cloves garlic, 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger, 1 tablespoon Sriracha, 1 teaspoon sesame oil, 1 teaspoon sesame seeds, 1 green onion
1. Heat peanut oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
2. In a large bowl, combine steak and 2 tablespoons cornstarch, tossing to coat and letting the steak absorb the cornstarch. Add remaining 2 tablespoons cornstarch before adding to the stockpot.
3. Working in batches, cook steak until golden and crisp, about 2-3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
4. In a medium saucepan over medium high heat, combine soy sauce, brown sugar, orange juice, vinegar, garlic, ginger, Sriracha and sesame oil until slightly thickened, about 1-2 minutes. Stir in steak and gently toss to combine.
5. Serve immediately, garnished with sesame seeds and green onion, if desired.
