Chicken Fried Rice
⅓ cup oyster sauce, 2 tablespoons rice vinegar, ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, 1 pound boneless chicken thighs, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 1 small onion, 1 (3.5-ounce) package shiitake mushrooms, 2 medium carrots, 3 cloves garlic, 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger, ½ cup frozen green peas, 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil, 4 cups leftover white or brown rice, 3 large eggs, 2 green onions, 2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds
1. In a small bowl, whisk together oyster sauce, rice vinegar and red pepper flakes.
2. Season chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
3. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Working in batches, add chicken to the skillet in a single layer and cook until golden brown, about 7-8 minutes; set aside.
4. Add onion, mushrooms and carrots to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3-4 minutes.
5. Stir in garlic and ginger until fragrant, about 1 minute.
6. Stir in green peas until heated through, about 1-2 minutes; set aside.
7. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and sesame oil over medium high heat.
8. Spread rice in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, for 2 minutes. Flip and spread in an even layer again, cooking for an additional 2 minutes.
9. Push rice to one side of the skillet; add eggs to opposite side of the skillet, and cook, stirring often, until thickened and no visible liquid egg remains, about 2-3 minutes.
10. Stir in chicken, vegetables and oyster sauce mixture until well combined, about 2-3 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring constantly, until flavors have blended, about 3-5 minutes.
11. Serve immediately, garnished with green onions and sesame seeds, if desired.
